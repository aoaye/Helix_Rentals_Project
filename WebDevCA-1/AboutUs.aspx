        <h2>About Us</h2>
             <p>
                We are a car rental company founded in Virginia, Cavan. 
                We have been renting cars for the past 30 years plus after we first opened in 1990.
                We rent cars from several different brands but our main focus is on german brands 
                such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW, but that doesnt mean that we dont offer other cars.
                Depending on your purpose we offer everything from small hatchbacks, to family SUVS, to
                luxury cars, to exotic sports cars and even limousines for your special events. We currently
                have 4 branches around Ireland where you can pick up a car for use, namely in Virginia, Cavan,
                Blanchardstown, Dublin, Limerick and Galway. We have over 80 staff spread accross all our branches
                 and you will be able to learn more about them on our <a href="Staff.aspx">staff</a> page.
                <br />
                <br />
                We offer our services while keeping a few things in mind, the first of which is - The customer
                is key. What this means is that we strive to offer the bestfor all our customers, making sure
                that each and every vehicle is regularly inspected for safety and comfort. Each and everyone of
                our vehicles is serviced once every 3 months, and maintenance is carried out monthly. We always 
                make sure that our MOT is done, and our insurance policies and rates are meticulously crafted to 
                provide you with the best peace of mind that you could possible have.
                <br />
                <br />
                Secondly, we understand that it might not be the easiest thing to return our cars to the same 
                location that it was rented from, hence we are partnered with 6 other rentals that have a combined 
                total of 25 sites accross the country. That means you have the option of 29 different branches to 
                drop of your rented car after the contracted period of use.
